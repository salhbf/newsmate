  The Sudan War: A Struggle for Power and Influence Beyond Borders

Khartoum – Our Correspondent:
Since the outbreak of armed clashes in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan has been plunged into one of the most devastating wars in its modern history. What began as a dispute over the integration of paramilitary forces into the national army has turned into a full-scale war where local and regional interests collide.

---

Roots of the Crisis

The conflict traces back to the fall of President Omar al-Bashir’s regime in 2019, which ushered Sudan into a fragile transitional phase between civilian and military factions. Over time, tensions escalated between the head of the army, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemeti), commander of the RSF, over control of the military and the future of political power.

The breaking point came when Hemeti rejected the proposed timeline to integrate his forces into the regular army, seeing it as a threat to his power. Burhan, on the other hand, viewed the RSF’s autonomy as a danger to state sovereignty. By mid-April 2023, the standoff exploded into violent battles across Khartoum and the Darfur and Kordofan regions.

Beneath the military confrontation lie complex economic and geopolitical factors.
Sudan is rich in gold and fertile land, and its location on the Red Sea makes it a strategic prize for regional powers. The competition for control over these resources and key state institutions has fueled the conflict and deepened divisions among rival elites.

---

Regional Dynamics and the UAE’s Role

The Sudanese government accuses the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of directly supporting the RSF with funding and weapons—allegations that Abu Dhabi firmly denies, insisting its role is “purely humanitarian.”

However, several international reports and investigations suggest that weapons and military equipment have entered Sudan through Chad, allegedly originating from the UAE. The Emirates is also one of the largest importers of Sudanese gold, giving it economic leverage and a vested interest in maintaining ties with whichever faction controls the country’s mining regions.

In March 2025, Sudan filed a lawsuit against the UAE at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of violating the Genocide Convention by financing and arming militias in Darfur. The UAE rejected the accusations at the United Nations, calling them “baseless” and reaffirming its commitment to “humanitarian aid and peaceful mediation.”

Humanitarian Situation

The war has created an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.
According to the United Nations, more than 9 million people have been displaced internally, and over two million have fled to neighboring countries—making it the world’s largest displacement crisis today. Infrastructure in the capital has been shattered, and essential services such as healthcare and education have all but collapsed.

---

Prospects for Peace

Regional and international efforts to broker a lasting ceasefire continue, but negotiations remain deadlocked due to deep mistrust between the warring parties and the involvement of external actors. Analysts warn that a sustainable peace will require regional consensus and an end to foreign support that fuels the conflict.

---

Conclusion
The war in Sudan is not merely a clash between two armies—it is a complex confrontation over power, wealth, and geography, intertwined with regional rivalries. While civilians bear the heaviest cost, Sudan’s fate ultimately depends on whether its leaders—and regional players like the UAE—recognize that in such a war, there can be no true victor, only devastation.
